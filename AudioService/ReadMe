Error handling seems not very qulity.

add complex mix following instructions.

Previosly, using plain string as instruction, but as the complexity insreased when volume control added, changed to using json string.
A sample json string is "[{\"startPosition\":100, \"endPosition\":200, \"bgmFileUrl\":\"%@\", \"volumeControl\":[{\"startPosition\":0, \"endPosition\":50, \"volumeLevel\":50},{\"startPosition\":50, \"endPosition\":100, \"volumeLevel\":100}]}, {\"startPosition\":300, \"endPosition\":5000, \"bgmFileUrl\":\"%@\", \"volumeControl\":[{\"startPosition\":0, \"endPosition\":1000, \"volumeLevel\":150},{\"startPosition\":1000, \"endPosition\":2000, \"volumeLevel\":50}]}]"
Notice every emelement enclosed by qutoe markers.
A human friendly view is:
[
    {
        "startPosition":1000,
        "endPosition":2000,
        "bgmFileUrl":"/path/to/bgm",
        "volumeControl":[
            {
                "startPosition":0,
                "endPosition":500,
                "volumeLevel":50
            },
            {
                "startPosition":501,
                "endPosition":1000,
                "volumeLevel":100
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "startPosition":3000,
        "endPosition":5000,
        "bgmFileUrl":"/path/to/bgm",
        "volumeControl":[
            {
                "startPosition":0,
                "endPosition":1000,
                "volumeLevel":100
            },
            {
                "startPosition":1001,
                "endPosition":2000,
                "volumeLevel":50
            }
        ]
    }
]

Able to handle instructions has repeat bgm url, system will not access the file twice, instead only once.

JSONParser is not in use as the result of parsing is a NSArray rather than NSDictionary, and JSONParser cannot handle this.

Supposed to create a new class to parse volume control as an object, but for the reason of lack of time, may implement later.

Comment code of complex_mix with parsing which using string instructions.

Rid off button json parse touch down action as previously it is used to test complex_mix_json.

The percison of packetd location seems good, but might be not quite precise. Plus volume control need more test on the volume level.

Then test again. Passed.

Add audio editor to cut audio.

The sample instructions
"79,579;989,1489;3200,4350;"
written in plain string. Instituted of end and start pairs separated by ',' and different instructions
separated by '.'.

Did very basic test and passed.
